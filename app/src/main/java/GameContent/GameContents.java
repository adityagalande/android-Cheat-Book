            "need to start one.\n" +
            "\n" +
            "1. Chipping the ball\n" +
            "When the ball is rolling towards you on the ground, you can drive into it without \n" +
            "jumping to get the ball to jump upwards. If you are travelling fast, the ball will \n" +

            "\n" +
            "2. Bounce dribbling\n" +
            "To do it, chip the ball up very slightly, as we covered in the previous section. \n" +
            "Boost into the ball again just after it bounces. You can keep repeating this. The \n" +

            "the ball onto your roof, practice jumping or flipping in any direction to see the \n" +
            "effect it has on the ball. The only way to get consistently good at balancing the \n" +
            "ball on your car is to practice it in freeplay. Experiment with altering the throttle \n" +
            "amount (if you’re on a controller) and feathering the boost (tapping it repeatedly \n" +
            "instead of holding it) to balance it.\n" +

            "4. Wall hits\n" +
            "To practice wallhits just go into freeplay and hit the ball up the wall. Then drive \n" +
            "up the wall and hit it. For harder hits try and be lower down than the ball when you \n" +

            "The easiest way is using bounce dribbling. Do the pop we covered earlier where you \n" +
            "jump under the ball when it’s just bounced. Now, as you pull the nose of your car up, \n" +

            "can send you quite a distance (in proportion, of course). When you want to carry the \n" +
            "ball forwards, be slightly behind and under the ball. When you are high enough, you \n" +
            "can guide the ball in different directions, but remember, if you stop touching the \n" +
            "bottom of the ball, gravity will take hold, so only do it at the end of your dribble. \n" +
